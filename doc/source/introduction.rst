Introduction
============

FORM (Flexible-grained Object-oriented Reading/Writing Model)  is a configuration-driven persistence infrastructure, developed for Phlex, providing a structured approach to data storage and retrieval for scientific computing workflows. FORM serves as a mediation layer between the phlex physics framework and storage systems, translating high-level data product concepts into persistence operations through declarative configuration. The design maintains clean separation between phlex-specific and persistence concerns, enabling future portability while meeting current Phlex requirements.
