==============================

   Comment (Preface for report and/or book)
   FORM (Flexible-grained Object-oriented Reading/Writing Model)  is a configuration-driven persistence infrastructure developed for Phlex. It provides a structured approach to data storage and retrieval for scientific computing workflows, with support for flexible data granularity.
   
   FORM serves as a mediation layer between the phlex physics framework and underlying storage systems, translating high-level data product definitions intro concrete persistence operations through declarative configuration.
